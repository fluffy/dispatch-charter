# Charter for Working Group

The Dispatch working group is chartered to consider proposals for
new work in the ART area and identify, or help create, an appropriate
venue for the work. 

Guiding principles for the proposed new work include: 

1. Providing a clear problem statement, motivation and deliverables for the proposed new work.

2. Ensuring there has been adequate mailing list discussion reflecting sufficient interest, individuals have expressed a willingness to contribute and there is WG consensus before new work is dispatched.

3. Looking for and identifying commonalities and overlap amongst published or ongoing protocol work.  Such commonalities may indicate the possibility of reusing existing protocols or elements thereof published by other WGs, or expanding and/or refactoring the scope of deliverables in an active WG. 

4. Protecting the architectural integrity of IETF protocols.   Ensure that new work has general applicability or is properly scoped in cases where the applicability is limited, but IETF has the expertise to develop such (e.g., proposals from other SDOs).

5. Ensuring the new work considers the impact on security and privacy of both the network and the user.  

Options for handling new work include:

- Directing the work to an existing WG.
- Developing a proposal for a BOF.
- Developing a charter and establishing consensus for a new WG.
- By agreement with ART ADs, Dispatch can process simple documents or progress documents as AD sponsored. 
- Deferring the decision for the new work.  
- Rejecting the new work.  

If the group decides that a particular topic needs to be addressed by
a new or existing WG, the normal IETF chartering process will be
followed, including, for instance, IETF-wide review of the proposed
changes. Proposals for large work efforts SHOULD lead to a BOF where
the topic can be discussed in front of the entire IETF community. 
Typically, the simple documents processed as Dispatch WG documents would include IANA registrations or changes to IANA registration procedures.  Documents progressed as AD sponsored would typically include those that do not have general 
applicability to IETF protocols, but rather are only applicable to specific use cases and network deployments, for which the scope must be clearly specified.
Proposed new work may be deferred in cases where the WG does not have enough information for the chairs to determine consensus.  New work may be rejected in cases where there is no WG interest or the proposal has been considered and rejected in the past and no new compelling reasons for accepting the new work are presented.

Since a major objective of the DISPATCH WG is to provide timely, clear
dispositions of new efforts. Thus, Where there is consensus to take
on new work, the WG will strive to quickly find a home for it.
